# Interview Ready: Claude Skill Package

A four-skill package that takes any job seeker from raw profile to hired. Covers onboarding, resume writing, job search evaluation, and full interview pipeline preparation through offer negotiation.

Works in Claude.ai (browser), Claude Desktop, and Claude Code. Gemini Gem port planned.

---

## What This Is

Interview Ready is a structured, research-grounded career preparation system built as Claude skills. Each skill is autonomous but context-aware: they share a user profile so you are never asked the same question twice across the workflow.

Every output is grounded in actual company research and your real background. This is not a template generator.

---

## The Four Skills

| Skill | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `skill-01-interviewer` | Onboards the user. Builds the shared profile: background, strengths, weaknesses, job search status and motivation. The starting point for every other skill. |
| `skill-02-resume-writer` | Accepts your resume via file upload or any document source. Rewrites or builds your resume and cover letter in professional, human language. Primary output is Word (.docx). |
| `skill-03-job-search` | Matches your profile to industries and roles. Evaluates job descriptions you bring: individually or in bulk. Tells you whether to apply and how to position. |
| `skill-04-interview-prep` | Prepares you for every stage of the hiring pipeline: recruiter screen, hiring manager, panel, final round, and offer negotiation. Research-grounded, role-specific, candidate-anchored prep documents. |

## Requirements

- Claude.ai account (Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise) or Claude Code
- Code Execution enabled: Settings → Capabilities → Code Execution (required for skills to load)
- No API key required. You bring your own Claude environment.

## Installation

### Option 1: Claude.ai or Claude Desktop (no technical setup required)

This is the path for most users.

**Step 1: Download the package**

On this GitHub page, click the green **Code** button, then click **Download ZIP**. Save the file to your computer.

**Step 2: Open Claude settings**

- In Claude.ai (browser): go to [claude.ai](https://claude.ai), click your profile icon in the top right, select **Settings**, then click **Features** in the sidebar, then **Skills**.
- In Claude Desktop: open the app, go to **Settings → Capabilities → Skills**.

**Step 3: Enable Code Execution**

In Settings → Capabilities, make sure **Code Execution** is turned on. Skills will not load without it.

**Step 4: Upload each skill**

Each skill is a separate folder inside the ZIP you downloaded. You need to upload them one at a time.

For each of the four skill folders (`skill-01-interviewer`, `skill-02-resume-writer`, `skill-03-job-search`, `skill-04-interview-prep`):

1. Create a new ZIP file containing just that one skill folder
2. Click **Upload skill** in the Skills settings panel
3. Select the ZIP file and upload it
4. Repeat for each skill

Once all four are uploaded, Claude will use them automatically when you start a job search session.

**How to zip a single skill folder (no coding required):**
- On Mac: right-click the skill folder → Compress
- On Windows: right-click the skill folder → Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder

### Option 2: Claude Code (command line)

If you use Claude Code, clone the repo and copy the skills to your skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ungatedbluemarble/interview-ready.git
cp -r interview-ready/skill-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

Or install per-project (shared with anyone who clones your repo):

```bash
cp -r interview-ready/skill-* .claude/skills/
```

---

### Option 3: Direct GitHub install (Claude Code one-liner)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills && \
  git clone https://github.com/ungatedbluemarble/interview-ready.git /tmp/interview-ready && \
  cp -r /tmp/interview-ready/skill-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

---

## Usage

Once installed, start with Skill 01. Everything else follows from there.

In any Claude session, say:

> "I'm ready to start Interview Ready."

or

> "I need help with my job search."

Skill 01 will onboard you, build your profile, and route you to the right skill based on what you need.

---

## Skill Trigger Reference

You can also go directly to any skill:

| What to say | Skill triggered |
|---|---|
| "Start Interview Ready" / "I need help with my job search" | Skill 01: Interviewer |
| "Write my resume" / "Update my cover letter" | Skill 02: Resume Writer |
| "Find jobs for me" / "Review this job description" | Skill 03: Job Search Expert |
| "I have an interview" / "Prep me for my interview" | Skill 04: Interview Prep |

---

## Bringing In Your Documents

You can feed your resume and other career documents to this package from any source:

- **Direct upload**: drag and drop a file into the Claude chat window
- **Copy and paste**: paste the text of a resume, job description, or any other document directly into chat
- **Cloud storage**: if you have a cloud storage connector enabled in Claude (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, SharePoint, or any other connected service), you can reference files stored there directly
- **Local files**: in Claude Code or Claude Desktop, you can reference files stored anywhere on your computer
- **Any format**: PDF, Word (.docx), plain text (.txt), or pasted text all work

The skills do not require any specific cloud service. Whatever document source you have access to works.

---

## How Context Works

The user profile built in Skill 01 carries forward into every other skill automatically. Skills pull only the slice of context they need: you are never re-asked for information you already provided.

**Session-persistent (default):** The profile lives in the active conversation. No file is written unless you request it. If you close the session, the profile does not carry over automatically.

**File-based (portable):** Export your profile at any time by saying "save my profile." It saves as `interview_ready_profile.json`. In future sessions, upload that file and any skill reloads your full profile without re-interviewing you.

**Performance note:** Long sessions with heavy document processing: multiple resume revisions, several prep documents: may approach Claude's context limits. If that happens, export your profile, start a new session, upload the file, and continue. The skill will pick up where you left off.

## Disclaimer

Interview Ready is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal, financial, or professional career advice. Compensation data, salary law guidance, and negotiation strategies are research aids, not legal or financial counsel. Use your own judgment and consult a qualified professional where appropriate.

---

## A Note on Salary Law Intelligence

Skill 04 includes a live salary law search that runs on first use and refreshes automatically every 90 days (one US fiscal quarter). When you reach the compensation section of any recruiter screen prep, the skill searches for current salary history and expectation ban laws in your state and city, summarizes what applies to you, and cites the source.

This search is live, not static. The skill does not rely on a fixed list that ages out. It pulls current information, stores the result in your profile, and tells you when it will refresh next.

The result is always accompanied by a disclaimer directing you to your state labor department to verify, because laws change and a web search is not a substitute for official guidance. The skill makes this clear every time.

If you are outside the United States, the skill runs a country and city-specific search instead and flags when reliable information could not be confirmed.

---

## A Note on LinkedIn

LinkedIn blocks automated content fetching. When this package researches a hiring manager, it extracts their name and company from the URL you provide and runs web search queries instead, synthesizing results from public sources: posts, articles, events, and announcements. If minimal public data exists for an interviewer, the skill flags it and focuses on role-level signals instead.

---

## Troubleshooting

**Skills are not triggering**
Make sure Code Execution is enabled in Settings → Capabilities. Skills will not load without it.

**Document upload is not working**
Any file format Claude supports works: PDF, Word, or plain text. If a file fails to upload, paste the text directly into chat instead.

**Session ran out of context**
Say "save my profile" before the session ends. Upload the saved file in a new session to continue without losing your work.

## Companion Tools

Interview Ready handles research, documents, and interview preparation. It does not replace a dedicated application tracker. If you are managing more than three active pipelines at once, a visual tracker alongside this package will help you stay organized.

**Application tracking**

These tools are purpose-built for tracking job applications, pipeline stages, contacts, and follow-up dates. All are free to start and require no technical setup.

| Tool | Best For | URL |
|---|---|---|
| Huntr | Dedicated job search tracker with Kanban board, contact management, and resume storage | huntr.com |
| Teal | Job tracker with built-in resume builder and job description analysis | tealhq.com |
| Notion | Flexible tracker if you prefer to build your own board with custom fields | notion.so |
| Airtable | Spreadsheet-style tracker with filtering and views, good for high-volume searches | airtable.com |
| Google Sheets | No-frills option if you want full control and nothing else | sheets.google.com |

None of these are affiliated with or required by this package. They are listed because they solve a problem this package intentionally does not: visual pipeline management across many concurrent applications.

**Using your Interview Ready profile as the source of truth**

Your exported `interview_ready_profile.json` contains an `interview_history` field that tracks every company, role, pipeline stage, and prep session you have run. You can ask Claude at any point:

> "Show me the status of all my active applications."

Claude will read your profile and summarize where you stand across every pipeline you are tracking. This works best when you save your profile after each session so the history stays current.

**Compensation research**

When preparing for offer negotiation, these sources provide current market data:

| Source | Best For |
|---|---|
| Levels.fyi | Verified compensation data for tech roles, especially engineering and product |
| Glassdoor | Broad compensation ranges across industries, self-reported |
| LinkedIn Salary | Role and location-specific ranges tied to real job postings |
| Payscale | Detailed breakdown by experience, education, and geography |
| Bureau of Labor Statistics (bls.gov) | Authoritative government data for US occupational wages |

Skill 04 will research compensation ranges for your target role during offer negotiation prep. These sources are listed so you can cross-reference independently.
